中文
English
Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.

Example
Given graph:

  	A----->B----->C
	 \     |
	  \    |
	   \   |
	    \  v
	     ->D----->E

Example 1:
Input:s = B and t = E,
Output:true

Example 2:
Input:s = D and t = C,
Output:false
