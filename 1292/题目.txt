1292. Odd Even Linked List
ÖÐÎÄ
English

Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
Example

Example1:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL

Example2:

Input: 2->1->null
Output: 2->1->null

Notice

The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
