135. Combination Sum
中文
English
Given a set of candidtate numbers candidates and a target number target. Find all unique combinations in candidates where the numbers sums to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

Example
Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7], target = 7
Output: [[7], [2, 2, 3]]
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [1], target = 3
Output: [[1, 1, 1]]
Notice
All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
Numbers in a combination a1, a2, … , ak must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak)
Different combinations can be in any order.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
