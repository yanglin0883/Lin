ÖÐÎÄ
English

Determine the number of bits required to flip if you want to convert integer n to integer m.
Example

Example 1:
	Input: n = 31, m = 14
	Output:  2
	
	Explanation:
	(11111) -> (01110) there are two different bits.


Example 2:
	Input: n = 1, m = 7
	Output:  2
	
	Explanation:
	(001) -> (111) will change two bits.


Notice

Both n and m are 32-bit integers.
