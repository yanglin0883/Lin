95. Validate Binary Search Tree
ÖÐÎÄ
English

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
    A single node tree is a BST

Example

Example 1:

Input:  {-1}
Output£ºtrue
Explanation£º
For the following binary tree£¨only one node£©:
	      -1
This is a binary search tree.

Example 2:

Input:  {2,1,4,#,#,3,5}
Output: true
For the following binary tree:
	  2
	 / \
	1   4
	   / \
	  3   5
This is a binary search tree.
