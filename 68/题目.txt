ÖÐÎÄ
English

Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Example

Example 1:

Input£º{1,2,3}
Output£º[2,3,1]
Explanation:  
   1
  / \
 2   3
 it will be serialized {1,2,3}
Post order traversal

Example 2:

Input£º{1,#,2,3}
Output£º[3,2,1]
Explanation:  
1
 \
  2
 /
3
it will be serialized {1,#,2,3}
Post order traversal

Challenge

Can you do it without recursion?
Notice

    The first data is the root node, followed by the value of the left and right son nodes, and "#" indicates that there is no child node.
    The number of nodes does not exceed 20.
