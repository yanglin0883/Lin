597. Subtree with Maximum Average
中文
English
Given a binary tree, find the subtree with maximum average. Return the root of the subtree.

Example
Example 1

Input：
{1,-5,11,1,2,4,-2}
Output：11
Explanation:
The tree is look like this:
     1
   /   \
 -5     11
 / \   /  \
1   2 4    -2 
The average of subtree of 11 is 4.3333, is the maximun.
Example 2

Input：
{1,-5,11}
Output：11
Explanation:
     1
   /   \
 -5     11
The average of subtree of 1,-5,11 is 2.333,-5,11. So the subtree of 11 is the maximun.
Notice
LintCode will print the subtree which root is your return node.
It's guaranteed that there is only one subtree with maximum average.
